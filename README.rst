This is a module for the `Insight Toolkit (ITK) <http://itk.org>`_ for
segmentation and registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4 modular
system.

This module is a template to be used as a starting point for a new ITK module.


Getting Started
---------------

The following is a brief list of instructions to get a external module
started in a new repository::

  mkdir ITK/Modules/External/ITKMyModule
  cd ITK/Modules/External/ITKMyModule
  git init
  git fetch https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKGraphCutSegmentation.git
  git merge FETCH_HEAD
  rm -rf .git
  git init
  git add . .*
  git commit -m "ENH: Initial ITKGraphCutSegmentation import"

Create a new repository account via GitHub's web interface. The module should
follow the naming convention, *ITK<MyModuleName>*.

Search and replace *GraphCutSegmentation* with *MyModuleName* in ``CMakeLists.txt``
and ``itk-module.cmake``.

Documentation on `how to populate the module
<https://itk.org/ITKSoftwareGuide/html/Book1/ITKSoftwareGuide-Book1ch9.html#x50-1430009>`_
can be found in the `ITK Software Guide
<https://itk.org/ITKSoftwareGuide/html/>`_.


Remote Module
-------------

After an `Insight Journal <http://www.insight-journal.org/>`_ article has been
submitted, the module can be included in ITK as a `remote module
<http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Policy_and_Procedures_for_Adding_Remote_Modules>`_.
Add a file in "ITK/Modules/Remote" called "YourModule.remote.cmake", for this
module it would be "ExternalExample.remote.cmake" with the followlowing
contents::

  itk_fetch_module(MyModule
    "A description of the a module."
    GIT_REPOSITORY http://github.com/myuser/ITKMyModule.git
    GIT_TAG abcdef012345
    )


Python Packages
---------------

After enabling builds for the GitHub repository with a `CircleCI
<https://circleci.com/>`_, `TravisCI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_,
and `AppVeyor <https://www.appveyor.com/>`_ account, Python wheel
packages will be available with the continuous integration builds.

  Linux Python package wheel links can be found in the CircleCI *Artifacts*
  tab after expanding the available folders.
